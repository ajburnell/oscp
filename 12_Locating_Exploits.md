# Locating Exploits

Search for an exploit for an application on a particular site:  
`firefox --search "Microsoft Edge site:exploit-db.com"`  

`exploitdb` for offline use is split into shellcodes and exploits, and further subdivided based on architecture:  
`ls -1 /usr/share/exploitdb/`

`searchsploit` provides an interface to search the exploitdb. For example, to search for remote smb windows exploits:  
`searchsploit remote smb microsoft windows`  

Nmap NSE scripts also have exploits for a variety of attacks such as brute forcing and fuzzing:  
```bash
cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts
grep Exploits *.nse
nmap --script-help=clamav-exec.nse
```

The Browser Explotation Framework (BeEf) is a tool that fouses on client-side attacks within the web browser:  
`sudo beef-xss`  
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel`  

Browsers need to be 'hooked' in which is discussed later. See the exercises for this section for more exploit details.
