NMap can also be used for vuln scanning with NSE scripts written in Lua and stored in:
`cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/`
`script.db` stores the scripts and can be searched...
`head -n 5 script.db`

`cat script.db  | grep '"vuln"\|"exploit"'`

Note that intrusive scripts can be stripped down exploits and cause damage to systems. Use with caution and consider safe scripts only.

Let's try to use the NSE to detect a vulnerability. For this example, we will use --script vuln to run all scripts in the "vuln" category against a target in the PWK labs:
`sudo nmap --script vuln 10.11.1.10`
